> Tested on x86_64 Linux

This script is for educational purposes only and should not be used for gain an unfair advantage during assessments.

!! IMPORTANT: If you use this on an activity, always copy the current state of your activity to a seperate backup file. Sometimes the activity wizard messes with the completion of the activity.

See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for setup and installation instructions.
